# I'm Kodjine

I like  **AI** and **data science** (well lets say I like data in all its forms!). I have been actively pursuing ways to expand my knowledge and understanding of these topics. 
I have always been passionate about the power of technology to transform the world. I enjoy developing models to tackle a wide range of problems.
I  have begun my journey with a Bachelor in software engineering followed by a Master of engineering in computer science and engineering. Throughout my journey, I have acquired skills in programming languages and software architecture. But the love for data and the advent of artificial intelligence captured my attention leading to a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on AI and data science from the University of Montreal, where I have deepened my understanding of machine learning and statistical analysis.
Since then, I have worked with companies and organizations across a wide range of industries, from academia to aerospace. I have developed and implemented AI solutions and published peer-reviewed papers.
